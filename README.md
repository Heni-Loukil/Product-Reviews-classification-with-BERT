# Product-Reviews-classification-with-BERT
This mini project consists of classifiying the sentiments of users based on their product reviews using DistilBert which finally will classify the review as a positive or a negative one.
First of all you need to import and download all necessary resources and libraries.
After that we can begin working with one of the Amazon Products DataSets which you'll find in TensorFlow DataSets, You can find the one I used through this link : https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/amazon_us_reviews#amazon_us_reviewsmobile_electronics_v1_00
After, you can follow the steps one by one as I did in the ipynb to train the model and then test it through various sentences of your choice or already existing Test Samples 
NB : I reduced the number of rows to half because I was using Google Colab, you can reserve some rows as Testing Samples
